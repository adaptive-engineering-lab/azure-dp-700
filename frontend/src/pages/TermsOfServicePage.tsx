          progress across devices and unlock Pro features you must create an

          We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these rules

      </Section>

      <Section title="4. Free and Pro tiers">
        <p>
          All study content (every question, mode, and domain) is available
          on the free tier. Pro is a cosmetic upgrade only &mdash; extra
          themes, advanced statistics panel, and the exam countdown widget.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Pro is billed monthly through Stripe at the price displayed at
          checkout. You can cancel anytime from Settings → Billing → Manage
          subscription. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current
          billing period; you keep Pro access until then. We do not offer
          refunds for partial periods.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          We may change Pro pricing or feature scope with 30 days&rsquo;
          notice. Active subscribers keep their existing rate for the
          current period.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="5. Content accuracy">
        <p>
          Study material is curated and reviewed to align with the
          AI-300 exam objectives at the time of writing. Microsoft updates
          exam objectives and Azure features regularly; we make no
          guarantee that every item perfectly reflects the current state of
          the exam or the underlying products.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>Passing the exam is your responsibility.</strong> The
          Service is one study tool among many; we don&rsquo;t guarantee a
          pass, and no part of these Terms creates a refund right based on
          your exam outcome.
        </p>
      </Section>

        <p>

          You retain ownership of your account inputs (display name,
          ratings, notes). By using the Service, you grant us a limited
          licence to process those inputs solely to operate the Service for
          you.

          changes may make parts of the Service temporarily unavailable.

          You can stop using the Service or delete your account at any time
          (Settings → Delete account). We can suspend or terminate accounts

          on the home page or by email at least 14 days before they take
